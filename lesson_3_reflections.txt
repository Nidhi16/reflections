When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When we want to collaborate with people, when we want to work on a big project by collaborating with our team member then we want to create a remote repository. Also by creating remote repository all of our works is saved when our laptop or machine which we worked upon is crashed or lost or damaged by some reason, then still we can see our repositories by another laptop or machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because remote server or we can say github can not directly clone our local repos which are on our local computer, so they can not up to date our local repositories. that's why we always pull changes manually to stay up to date with our remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When we clone or make copies of others repository which is hosted on remote servers like Github to our repository which is also on Github, then this process is known as forking.
When we make copy of other repository which is hosted on remote server like Github or on our local computer to our local computer then this is known as cloning.
And when we work on a single repository, and break a main file into fragments to do extra features or solve bugs, then this is known as branching.
We use fork when we want to make copy of others repository on our repository on Github.
We use clones when we want to make copy of others repository which is on github to our local computer.
We use branch when we want to add extra features on the project.
